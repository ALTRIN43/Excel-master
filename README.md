# Excel Data Cleaning, Preparation, and Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the process of **data cleaning**, **preparation**, **analysis**, and **pivoting** using Microsoft Excel. It includes two files: one representing the raw, uncleaned data, and the other representing the cleansed and analyzed data. This project focuses on transforming messy data into valuable insights.

## Project Files

1. **start.xlsx**  
   The starting file contains errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data. This file represents the initial state of the dataset before any cleaning or analysis.

2. **end.xlsx**  
   The final file after performing data cleaning, preparation, and analysis. It includes the following:
   - Removal of duplicates
   - Correcting errors
   - Data preparation for analysis
   - Pivoting the data to summarize and extract insights

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing values, errors, and duplicates.
- **Data Preparation**: Formatting the data for analysis, including handling data types, outliers, and inconsistent formats.
- **Data Analysis**: Performing data analysis to extract key insights from the dataset.
- **Pivot Tables**: Using pivot tables to summarize and analyze data in a meaningful way.
  
## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Data Cleaning Techniques

## How to Use

1. Download the project files (`m------_F------_E---START.xlsx` and `m------_F------_E---END.xlsx`).
2. Open the **start.xlsx** file to view the uncleaned data.
3. Follow the data cleaning, preparation, and analysis process outlined in the project to create the **end.xlsx** file.
4. Use the **end.xlsx** file to see the final, analyzed data, including pivoted tables and clean data.

## Conclusion

This project is an essential practice for anyone looking to improve their skills in Excel for data analysis. It covers fundamental techniques such as cleaning data, preparing it for analysis, and summarizing it using pivot tables. This project will help you work with real-world messy data and prepare it for analysis and decision-making.
